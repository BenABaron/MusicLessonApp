# What am  I trying to solve
Many music teachers are moving to online lessons, so I want to create a website where students can connect to teachers and schedule lessons through the site. For now, I plan on having just a single teacher for simplicity purposes.

# Who will interact with the App
Students and Teachers. Anyone will be able to create a student account.

# Core functionality
1. Register new students
2. Allow students/teacher to log in
3. Allow students to request lessons from the teacher
4. Allow the teacher to accept lesson requests

# Future enhancements
1. Allow the teacher to get their lessons for the week
2. Allow the teacher to edit lessons
3. Allow the teacher to update recurring lessons
4. Allow the teacher to make lesson exceptions
